            <p><b>Why is it necessary ?</b></p>
		<p>At Endow.AI, Our fundamental and applied research teams work together to advance AI
research and build products that solve real-world business problems.
Smart environmental protection plays an important role in solving the problems of
environmental pollution and resource waste in the process of urban development. It also
improves the sustainable development ability of the city and the quality of life of urban
residents.</p>
<p>To ensure the long-term stability of urban water, quality is one of the key points of water
environment management and smart environmental protection construction.
We at Endow.AI tried to devise an AI driven Water quality management system in order to
improve upon essential environmental indicators of metropolis. </p>
<p>We sought to develop a three-layer architecture system which helped us to solve following
problems:<br>
1. The data collected by the sensors is very hard to analyze for humans.<br>
2. It requires a lot of time in order to do analysis by the external analyst.<br>
3. Predicting the disturbance in the water quality system ahead of time.<br>
4. Taking action once the disturbance is detected also requires a lot of time
and analysis, hence pollution source tracing might be helpful.<br>
5. Understanding the type of data should be used for better analysis using
Machine learning methods.<br>
6. Notifying the people on the support side about the disturbance.</p>
<p><b>How did we do it ?</b></p>
<p>We built an intelligent management system to safeguard urban water quality.<br>
.The system integrated smart enabling technologies such as environmental
sensing, big data, artificial intelligence, environmental models, and IoTs.<br>
. It helped us to design the Decision Support System for urban water monitoring using the
predictions made by the early warning Anomaly detection system developed.<br>
.The anomaly detection system used the time series data collected from the Maozhou river
through IoT sensors and machine learning techniques were applied to analyze the data.<br>
.We developed a pollution source tracing algorithm for better treatment and to help managers
take quick actions in order to reduce the damage.<br>
.We have also developed a report function, so that when anomaly is detected it will send
messages to a person in charge<br>
.The pilot testing of the system was done in Shenzhen city and results were great.</p>
<p><b>What will be our future steps ?</b></p>
<p>.Consideration of human opinion into the loop for improvisation of results.<br>
. As the results produced by AI are based on collection data, it also gives insight on what type of
data might be beneficial for optimization purposes and upto what level we need, it will help us
focus on collecting good quality of data<br></p>
<p><b>Does this open a gateway for AI-driven water quality management ?</b></p>
<p>After successful testing of the pilot stage of this device in Maozhou River, Shenzhen city.
We realized that this opens a gateway for AI in the field of urban water quality management.
The AI techniques were quite beneficial for water quality analysis, as they are able to process a
huge amount of data quickly so as to draw conclusions that may have not been possible by
humans. This makes us realize that in the coming times, water quality forecasts for more
effective water treatment processes, make sure problems can be recognised ahead of time and
help direct efforts in those areas early enough. Compared with traditional water quality
monitoring methods, methods using AI and big data reflected the real situation of river water
quality more timely and comprehensively.</p>
